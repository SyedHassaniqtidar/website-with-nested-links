    Generally, a movie review is a genre of art criticism and journalism. It is a complex overview, usually made by a professional critic, of films that have just been released to help decide what movie to watch.

Professional reviews differ from those made by amateurs; they are more structured, sharper, and more detailed, but at the same time, more compact in wording. In a professional movie review, you will always find awareness of the film's director(s), their earlier works, and previous filmmaker's pictures, as well as a deep understanding of different film genres and filming techniques with modern trends.

Though you can find many reviews made by ordinary movie fans, they can sometimes be more informative and useful than professional ones.
